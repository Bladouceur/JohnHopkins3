# Introduction
The script called run_analysis.R performs the required 5 steps to complete the assessment. The five steps are:

## Deliverables
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
1. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
1. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
1. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
1. The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.

## Sequence
1. Merge the datasets with rbind;
1. Then select the columns related to mean and standard deviation;
1. Relabel activities from numbers to values that can be understood, in order to respect tidy principles;
1. Touch column names; and
1. Create the new dataset, as required in the deliverables.


## Variables
1. *X_train*, *y_train*, *X_test*, *y_test*, *subject_train* and *subject_test* contain the data from the downloaded files.
1. *x_all*, *y_all* and *subject_all* merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
1. *features* contains the correct names for the *x_all* dataset, which are applied to the column names that are in *features_mean_std*, a numeric vector used to get the data data.
1. A similar approach is taken with activity names through the *activity_labels* variable.
1. *x_extract* contains a table with the features selected
1. *all_data merges* *x_all*, *y_all* and *subject_all* in a single dataset.
Finally, *tidy* has the  averages which will be later stored in a .txt file. The plyr package was used to wrap everything together. Thank you.
